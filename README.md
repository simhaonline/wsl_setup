# WSL setup

This script is intended for my personal use only, but if you want to tweak it
for *your* personal use read along.

Go through wsl_setup.sh file in this repo, it is like the main() function of
this setup program. It works with both WSL v1 and v2.

The bash_snippets directory contain fragments of code to be inserted in
`~/.bashrc` and/or `~/.profile`, as well as config files like .vimrc and
.tmux.conf.

The misc directory contains things likes Windows Terminal settings and VS Code
settings.

Ignore the Powershell stuff for now, it is half-baked and very Ubuntu centric.
